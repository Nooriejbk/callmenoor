            <h2> Welcome!</h2>
            <p> Hello and welcome to the latest iteration of CallMeNoor.com! <br><br>
               You may have been here before, you may not have, so here's the rundown...<br><br>
              I'm Noor and this is my personal website. I bought the domain with no plan on what I wanted to do with it...
              so I've decided I'm going to use it to teach myself web development skills and also showcase any other bit
              and bobs I want to share.<br><br>
              The current plan is to update the site every month with new features and new info. Check out my new
              <a class="updatey" href="#updates"><strong>update</strong></a> section to see my progress. Next update : 1st October 2021 <br> <br>
              A little about myself, I'm about to go into a gap year from my BSc Computer Science to focus on upskilling. I'm prioritising
              coding languages and sewing but also working on the business venture I've set out for myself.<br><br>
              I'm also a Singer/Actress. Haven't been in much or performed in a while (pandemic :/) but when I do, it'll
              all be here.</p>

    <h3> Current Update </h3>
    <p> Ahh... The July/August update... where do I start? <br><br><strong>In the previous update I wanted to tackle:
    </strong> add a new item to portfolio; an opening slide to the updates and add a navigation bar.<br><br>
      So! Yes, July and August updates were merged into one update and were not even complete. The reason for that is
      I was sick. I had a bad reaction after my first covid jab right at the end of July and was recovering for most of
      August. But, I am all better now, working with some doctors to find out what happened and in terms of me keeping
      to this goal of a new update very month, I wouldn't consider this a fail as there was nothing I could've done.
      <br><br>
      Swiftly moving on... In terms of my first goal, Complete! I have added a website that I built previously to my new
      web development section of my portfolio. It was originally for a client but they no longer wanted it so I am now going
      to use it to display more of my development skills but have them more tailored to a niche. This one being fitness/personal
      training. <br><br>
      Originally I did think the opening slide was a good idea but now I'm not the biggest fan of this section of the website
      at all, therefore I didn't do it. I think instead I'm going to work on moving this section into it's own blog space so
      it doesn't take as much space as it does and the users who arent interested in the updates, don't have to see it.<br><br>
      Last but not least, the navigation bar. No, I wasn't able to complete the navigation bar for CallMeNoor but! I do
      have one on my fitness example on my portfolio... I still wouldn't consider the task complete but wasn't a complete fail.
      <br><br>
      Obviously this month's update wasn't the best in terms of updates and that's fine but next month I want to push it to
      the next level. When it comes to my web development skills, this site is definitely helping me practice but theres not
      many things im really learning, so to give myself a challenge I'm going to use the month of september to learn a new
      coding language (TBD). With that, in order to demonstrate my new skills I will attempt to upgrade a section of my
      site (also, TBD) using this new language. I think a lot of this months work will be upgrading as I also need to
      upgrade this updates section into a blog and the fitness website isn't complete, so I'll be working on that too.<br><br>
      <strong>For my next update I want to focus on:</strong> Move the update section to a blog, upgrade a section using a new
      coding language(not HTML/CSS/Javascript) and fix bugs and design flaws in the Fitness Example </p>

      <h3> June Update </h3>
      <p> My June update is the update I'm the most proud of at the minute. This is the start of CallMeNoor at
        it's fullest. <br><br><strong>In the previous update I wanted to tackle:</strong> continue button
        responsivness, put stuff in the portfolio and an update section for my progress.<br><br>
        I finally fixed the responsivness of my continue button, it took so long to work out that the span tag
        doesn't like percentage sizing... I hate working with pxl sizing so but I had to bite the bullet for this.
        With this I also fixed some general bugs like sizing or wrong colours.
        <br><br>
        I don't know what I was thinking before but the spotlight like was always a perfect thing to put in the
        portfolio and for whatever reason it took me 2 months to get to that conclusion. <br><br>And last but
        definitely not least, the amazing update section! For a small period of time I was stuck between having
        a slideshow style section with all the changes or a blog. I've made slideshows before and making a blog
        felt like a lot of extra effort for what it was worth. I do still like the idea of having a blog but I
        just don't have many ideas for content. <br><br>
        <strong>For my next update I want to focus on:</strong> add a new item to portfolio; an opening slide to
        the updates and add a navigation bar.</p>

      <h3> May Update </h3>
      <p> This was my first update for the website. I didn't want to throw myself into the deep end and instead
          decided to tackle a few things at a time.<br><br><strong>In the previous update I wanted to tackle:</strong>
          prettier continue button; more content; nicer footer.<br><br>
          The continue button was an easy fix I just overthought, honestly. With the content, I made a list of
          things I want and things I can do and believe it or not, there were no overlap...yeah. But I knew I
          wanted a place to display all of my work and I thought I can make space for that as if I'm telling
          people what my goals are so I could be held accountable for doing it. Oddly, the welcome section was a
          last minute decision to beef up the site and I've grown to it, so I think it's gonna stay. I got
          inspiration for the footer from several websites I visited but with a more minimal style as I don't
          actually have anything to put there.<br><br>
          <strong>For my next update I want to focus on:</strong> responsivness of elements and put something in the portfolio,
          it looks quite sad at the minute. I also want a place to store my progress with the site, maybe an
          update section (inception) or incorporate a blog some how.

      <h3> Original Website </h3>
      <p> In 2019 I set myself the task to update my website with my own coding, as previously it was a weebly site
         and made from a template I had customised.<br><br>

         As you can see, I was lacking content and ideas to the point where my amazing continue button would scroll
         about half a screen and reveal the whole site (How embarrassing...) <br><br>

         I don't remember how long I spent on this version but I couldn't think of anything else to put on this page
         and the things I did think of, I felt insecure about sharing.<br><br>

         <strong>For my update I want to focus on:</strong> the hideous continue button; the footer and the lack of content.
         All of which I tackled in the next version of the site.
